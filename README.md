# Reinforcement-learning

The project involves reinforcement learning with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), based on Schulman et al. (2016). This model-free policy gradient approach utilizes two neural networks, one as an actor and the other as a critic. The objective is to train a policy that can safely land a lunar lander between two flags with minimal fuel consumption and without causing damage.

Key challenges include working with dual neural network parametrizations, enhancing the reward system, and extending basic policy gradients with advantage estimation.

The baseline evaluation measures the expected cumulative reward of the final policy across an episode.
